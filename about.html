        1. The end is near.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. You’re strong. But I could snap my fingers, and you’d all cease to exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe. But this… does put a smile on my face.
    </p>

    <p>
        4. Stark… you have my respect. I hope the people of Earth will remember you.
    </p>

    <p>
        5. When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. I hope they remember you.
    </p>

    <p>
        6. You should have gone for the head.
    </p>

    <p>
        7. I know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.

    </p>

    <p>
        8. You’re a great fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.
    </p>

    <p>
        9. Going to bed hungry. Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what’s happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It’s a paradise.
    </p>

    <p>
        10. I’m the only one who knows that. At least I’m the only who has the will to act on it. For a time, you had that same will. As you fought by my side, daughter.
    </p>

    <p>
        11. I ignored my destiny once, I can not do that again. Even for you. I’m sorry Little one.

    </p>

    <p>
        12. With all six stones, I can simply snap my fingers, they would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.”
        “And then what?
    </p>

    <p>
        13. Thanos: “Daughter.”
        Gamora: “Did you do it?”
        Thanos: “Yes.”
        Gamora: “What did it cost?”
        Thanos: “Everything.”
    </p>

    <p>
        14. Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.
    </p>

    <p>
        15. You’re strong. Me… You’re generous. Me… But I never taught you to lie. That’s why you’re so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone?
    </p>

    <p>
        16. You should choose your words wisely
    </p>

    <p>
        17. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
    </p>
